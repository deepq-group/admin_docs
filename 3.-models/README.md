# 3. Models

Here the admin can view the list of all deployable models stored on the DeepQ AI platform. Completing a training task does not automatically make the model deployable, the adminsitrator will have to decide which model can be deployable. Clicking on the "IMPORT MODEL" button brings you to the model list
