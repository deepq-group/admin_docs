# 4.2.1 Deployment Statistics

Under the inference list is the deployment statistics section, where users can view the statistical information within a specific time range. There are three main statistical information that can produced within the given time range (the default time range is past 3 months)：

**Population statisics**：gender distribution, age distribution, average age & median age. If age/sex information is missing from any DICOM study it will be counted as unknown

**Inference statistics**：The bar graph of processed studies each day, and the number of triggered AI indicators (if any). Users can further look into the information by assgining a specific age range or gender.

**Processing time statisics：**Bar graph of the following time intervals per day：

1. Acquisition-to-Input time. The average time from image acquisition to image input (transfer complete to Deeploy system).
2. Input-to-Inference time. The average time from image input to inference complete.
3. Acquisition-to-Inference time. The mean time from image acquisition in the scan room to the generation of AI inference results, calculated by combining the averages of the two time intervals listed above.
