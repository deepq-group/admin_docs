# 4.2.1 Deployment Statistics

Under the inference list is the deployment statistics section, where users can view the statistical information within a specific time range. There are three main statistical information that can produced within the given time range (the default time range is past 3 months)：

**Population statisics**：gender distribution, age distribution, average age & median age. If age/sex information is missing from any DICOM study it will be counted as unknown
