# 2. Set Query

Each deployment will require query set(s) so that the model will run on the image data it is trained for. A query set is consisted of several DICOM tags, including Modality, Study Description, Series Description & Body Parts Examined.&#x20;

* In the case of multiple query sets in a deployment, clicking on the "**ADD QUERY**" icon on the  will bring up a new query set
* if only a few DICOM tags are different among multiple queries, clicking on the "**COPY**" button will create a new query set with the same setting of the current query set.
* "**DELETE**" icon (garbage can) removes a query set
