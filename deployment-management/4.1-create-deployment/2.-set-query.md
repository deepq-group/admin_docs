![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

Each deployment will require query set(s) so that the model will run on the image data it is trained for. A query set is consisted of several DICOM tags, including Modality, Study Description, Series Description & Body Parts Examined.&#x20;



![Other than the 4 DICOM tags listed, additional query items can be added to make the deployment more specific](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

* In the case of multiple query sets in a deployment, clicking on the "ADD QUERY" icon on the  will bring up a new query set
* if only a few DICOM tags are different among multiple queries, clicking on the "COPY" button will create a new query set with the same setting of the current query set.
* "DELETE" icon (garbage can) removes a certain query set
