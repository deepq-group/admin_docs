# 4.1 Create deployment

To create a deployment, the administrator will have to go through the following steps:

1. Select model to be deployed
2. Set query settings & worklist items
3. Set AI Indicators
4. Set authorization
5. Confirm & deploy

\*\*the maximum number of deployments is limited by the number of inference hardware (number of GPUs & 1 CPU). if all inference resources are occupied, selecting "**DEPLOY MODEL**" will jump out a warning window, informing the administrator to stop a running deployment in order to release a deployment resource.

If there is available inference resource, the administrator will go though a 5-step proccess to complete a model deployment.
