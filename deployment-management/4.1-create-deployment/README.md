# 4.1 Create deployment

To create a deployment, the administrator will have to go through the following steps:

1. Select model to be deployed
2. Define query settings
3. Set authorization
4. Confirm & deploy

\*\*the maximum number of deployments is limited by the number of inference GPUs. if all inference GPUs are occupied, selecting "DEPLOY MODEL" will jump out a warning window, informing the administrator to stop a running deployment in order to release a GPU.
