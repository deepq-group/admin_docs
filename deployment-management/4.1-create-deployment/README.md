# 4.1 Create deployment

To create a deployment, the administrator will have to go through 1 5-step process:

1. Select model to be deployed
2. Set query settings
3. Set Worklist items & AI Indicators
4. Set authorization
5. Confirm & deploy

\*\*the maximum number of deployments is limited by the number of inference hardware (number of GPUs & 1 CPU). if all inference resources are occupied, selecting "**DEPLOY MODEL**" will jump out a warning window, informing the administrator to stop a running deployment in order to release a deployment resource.

![Not enough inference resource notice will pop up if all GPU/CPU are in use](../../.gitbook/assets/Deeploy-adm-2-0-2.png)
