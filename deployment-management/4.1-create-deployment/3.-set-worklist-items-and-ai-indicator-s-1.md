### AI viewer - Inference Calculation

Other than direct inference results provided by each model, DeepQ AI viewer can also provide the following calculated results of the inference output:

**Object detection: Width ratio between 2 classes (max. bounding box width for each class)**

**Object segmentation: Total area ratio between two classes**

To show calculation results in the AI viewer, users will need to setup the calculation during deployment creation.
