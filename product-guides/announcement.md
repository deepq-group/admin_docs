#### Create New Announcement

* **Announcement Message:** The administrator can edit the content here, the max. number of characters is 250.
* **Date:** Each system announcement can be given an end date, the announcement will automatically be taken down once the end date is reached. if no end date is selected, users can still disable the announcement banner themselves.
* **Receiver:** announcements can be sent to all users or select users. The administrator can type in any account name and add him/her as the receiver of this announcement .
* **email:** Other than sending out system announcements (which can be seen only if the user logs into the platform), the same announcement can also be sent to the user's account email.

Once you announcement is sent via the platform, receiving users will notice a banner on top of the product once they login. Users may dismiss the notification by clicking on "GOT IT", or else it will disappear once the end date/time is reached.
